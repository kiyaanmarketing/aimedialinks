                                            PPC (Pay-Per-Click) is a form of online advertising where advertisers pay a fee each time their ad is clicked. It’s primarily used in search engine advertising, like Google Ads, where ads appear alongside search results. The goal is to drive traffic to a website, and advertisers only pay when someone clicks on their ad, making it a cost-effective way to attract potential customers.

                                            <b>SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</b> is the practice of optimizing your website and content to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs) for relevant queries. The goal of SEO is to increase organic (non-paid) traffic to your site by making it more visible to people searching for information, products, or services that you offer.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            SEO involves a combination of strategies and techniques aimed at improving various aspects of your website, from content and structure to user experience and backlinks. It’s a key part of digital marketing, as higher visibility in search results leads to more website visits, which can translate into more leads, conversions, and sales.

                                            <b>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</b> refers to the practice of using paid advertising to increase a website’s visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs). Unlike <b>SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</b>, which focuses on organic (non-paid) ranking, SEM involves paying for clicks on ads that appear when users search for specific keywords on search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. SEM is often used as an umbrella term that encompasses both <b>paid search ads</b> (PPC - Pay-Per-Click) and <b>search engine optimization</b>.

                                            The most common form of SEM is <b>PPC advertising</b>, where advertisers bid on keywords and pay for each click on their ads. These ads typically appear at the top, bottom, or side of the search results, marked with "Ad" or "Sponsored" labels.
                                        </p>

                                            <b>Brand awareness</b> refers to the degree to which consumers can recognize or recall a brand. It's a key aspect of brand marketing that indicates how familiar the target audience is with a company or product, and how likely they are to choose it over competitors when making purchasing decisions. Essentially, brand awareness is about getting your brand in front of the right people and ensuring that they remember your brand when it comes time to buy.

                                            The goal of brand awareness campaigns is not necessarily to drive immediate sales, but to <b>increase recognition and familiarity</b> with your brand, products, or services, making it the first choice in the minds of consumers when they need something you offer.
